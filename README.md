# YAHNW

[Yet another hacker news website](https://mitchelpaulin.github.io/YAHNW/). 

A web interface that lets you read Hacker News, uses a two pane design for comments and stories, intended for use on Desktop only. 

Made using the [official hacker news API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and React. Converted to TypeScript.

## Run the website locally

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
