# YAHNW

[Yet another hacker news website](https://mitchelpaulin.github.io/YAHNW/). 

A web interface that lets you read Hacker News using a two pane design for comments and stories. Designed for landscape displays (ie. monitors), does not work well in portrait. 

Made using the [official hacker news API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and React. Converted to TypeScript.

## Local Dev
